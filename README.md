# royalties

Some parts of this webapp are highly specific to InVadeRJ. Keep that in mind if you want to adapt it for your own project.

Planned features:
- Store revenue splits and each month's royalties in an [EdgeDB](https://www.edgedb.com/) database.
- Display the royalties relevant to each contributor through their own account.
- Allow admin accounts to view all royalties, create new releases and users, and input each month's royalties.
- Calculate each contributor's total payout amount, and display it in multiple currencies.
- Display transactions, created by admin accounts, to calculate each contributor's outstanding balance.
